# Modular C-arm Fluoroscopy: Appendix 1 Dataset

This repository hosts the **Appendix 1** from the doctoral thesis *"Kinematic Modeling, Trajectory Planning, and Machine Learning for integrated C-arm fluoroscopy and operating table systems".*  

The dataset provides detailed Excel sheets documenting **trajectory errors across multiple configurations and motion profiles**, with a specific emphasis on the **impact of overweight patient conditions**. These results highlight the variation in positional errors across trajectories such as polynomial, trapezoidal, minimum jerk, and minimum snap, and demonstrate how patient-specific conditions influence intraoperative imaging accuracy.

## Contents
- **Appendix1**  
  Contains tabulated experimental data on positional errors under normal and overweight patient conditions across all system configurations.

- **Documentation/**  
  Includes supplementary notes describing variables, units, and data collection methodology.

---

## Key Features
- Analysis of **Mean Value of Position Error (cm or degree)** across multiple system DoFs.  
- Comparison of **trajectory planning methods** in constrained surgical environments.  
- Evaluation of **patient condition effects**, with overweight cases showing increased errors.
